This is a personal landing page for showcasing projects that I've worked on as well as to re-familiarise myself with javascript and the React framework. It has been bootstrapped with the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I am currently in the process of making it more mobile friendly and applying responsive web design. My work experience has been centered around backend systems so this remains an ongoing learning opportunity.

## To run from source

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. Then uses the `gh-pages` npm package to push to a specified branch for hosting the github pages site.
